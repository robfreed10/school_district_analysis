# Overview of the School District Analysis
Maria was seeking thorough analysis of the PyCity School District. After taking a deep dive of the 15 schools in our dataset, results that will benefit the school district in the future for years to come. This analysis takes a deep dive of Thomas High School's 10th-12th graders, as well as the best and worst performing schools based on overall passing percentage. We also analyzed each grades average math and reading scores for the 15 schools in the data set. Lastly, we found data on the scores based on the school spending per student, by their school size, and by the type of school. 
# Results of the Analysis. 
The school district summary showed the analysis of 15 schools in the school district. Of the 15 total schools and 39,170 students, the total budget for all the schools was $24,649,428.00. The average math score was 78.9 with student passing percentage for math was 74.8%. The average reading score was 81.9 with a 85.7% passing percentage for reading. Overall, 64.9% of students passed both math and reading. The summary will be shown below.

The average score for reading was 83.89 with only 69.66% passing reading. Overall, only 65.08% of students passed both math and reading.

### Score by Grade Breakdown
Replacing the 9th graders did not really affect the math score breakdown by grade. Although if the 9th graders were analyzed, the 9th graders at Thomas High School would be the lowest scoring 9th graders of the 15 schools. The same can be said for the 9th graders reading score, as Thomas High School would have had the lowest reading scores for 9th graders of the 15 schools.

# Summary
Without the 9th graders from Thomas High School, Thomas High School catapults into the top 5 schools of the 15 in the PyCity School District. Without analyzing the 9th graders, it is not known that they would have the lowest average math and reading score of all the 9th grade students in the district. Without taking into account 9th graders at Thomas High School, it is one of the most efficient and successful schools.
